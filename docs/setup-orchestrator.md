## Set up your SSH

If you can connect to your node (or local machine) via ssh without password, then connection set up is right:

[try out your login](/ssh#step-3-try-out-your-login) and continue set up Orchestrator.

or:

go to the [set up SSH key](/ssh) guide and do all steps to create a new key and then return to this page.

## Create a new node

:::warning

The new node must include [SSH key](/ssh) path and include at least one [device or simulator](/udid).

:::

1. Go to the Sift Nodes page.

2. Click **Add Node** button.

3. Fill out all fields in the form.

- Name: This name will be displayed in the Orchestrator.
- Host: Your SIFT machine is going to connect to this node via ssh. Please provide the IP address of the node. Use `127.0.0.1` to run sift on local machine.
- Port: Your SIFT machine is going to connect to this node via ssh. Please provide the port. When running sift on a local machine the port should be `22`.
- Username: Name of your local machine.
- Path to private key: Your SIFT machine is going to connect to this node via ssh. Please provide the absolute path on the SIFT machine to a valid ssh private key which will be used for establishing a connection. By default it's located in `/Users/user_name/.ssh/id_rsa` where user_name is your machine username.

:::note
Please do not provide the value of the private key itself - this information is private and you should not share it with us.
:::

- Deployment Path: We will temporarily store the build & results here.

### Enviroment variables

Cooming soon. You can read more about Enviroment variables [here](/env-vars).

3. Save all changes by click **Update** button.

## Tell Orchestrator about your tests

1. Open the terminal.

2. Copy and Paste command:

<Tabs
  groupId="platforms"
  defaultValue="ios"
  values={[
    { label: "IOS", value: "ios" },
    { label: "Android", value: "android" },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="ios">
  In this case, sift executable is located at `/usr/local/bin/` directory and has name sift.


  ```
  sift orchestrator --token "your_token" --init
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="android">
  In this case, sift executable is located at `/usr/local/bin/` directory and has name sift.


  ```
  sift orchestrator init --token "your_token"
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

3. Instead of "your_token" use [your token](/settings#copy-the-token) from Global Settings.

## Create test plan

Go to the [guide](/test-plans#creating), create a new test plan and return here.

## Add tests to test plan

Go to the [guide](/test-plans#adding-tests-to-test-plan), add tests to the created test plan and return here.
