## Set up your SSH

Go to the [set up SSH key guide](/ssh) and do all steps to create a new key and then return to this page.

## Create a new node

:::warning

The new node must include [SSH key](/ssh) path and include at least one [device or simulator](/udid).

:::

1. Go to the Sift Nodes page.

2. Click **Add Node** button.

3. Fill out all fields in the form.

- Name: This name will be displayed in the Orchestrator.
- Host: Your SIFT machine is going to connect to this node via ssh. Please provide the IP address of the node. Use `127.0.0.1` to run sift on local machine.
- Port: Your SIFT machine is going to connect to this node via ssh. Please provide the port. If you use local connections the default port will be `22`.
- Username: Name of your local machine.
- Path to private key: Your SIFT machine is going to connect to this node via ssh. Please provide the absolute path on the SIFT machine to a valid ssh private key which will be used for establishing a connection. By default it's located in `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

:::note
Please do not provide the value of the private key itself - this information is private and you should not share it with us.

- Deployment Path: We will temporarily store the build & results here.
- Xcode Path: Where is Xcode located? By default it's located in `/Applications/Xcode.app`.

### Enviroment variables

- Enviroment variables: This variables will be injected into your .xctestrun and can be used from test environment. You can read more about Enviroment variables [here](/env-vars).

- Tests Per Device: How many tests are allowed per one device / simulator?
- Timeout for Test: SIFT will abort the execution after this number of seconds.
